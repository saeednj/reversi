# reversi
A web-based version of [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) with AI.
You can play it [here](https://saeednj.github.io/reversi/).

The computer player uses alpha-beta pruning. It plays in 3 different difficulty levels:
easy, medium and hard, where the only difference is the maximum depth of the game tree
explored (1, 2 and 4, respectively).
